# Welcome to Neatline!

This guide is designed to be a comprehensive introduction to the Neatline project. We'll walk through the basic steps of [installing and configuring](installing-neatline.html) Neatline, [creating exhibits](exhibits-overview.html) and [records](records-overview.html), [importing](creating-records.html#bulk-importing-omeka-items) items from your [Omeka](http://omeka.org) collection, and [publishing](publishing-exhibits.html) your projects to the web.

Start with our [introduction](what-is-neatline.html), [browse](docs-TOC.html) the documentation, or search for specific topics.
