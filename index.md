# Welcome to Neatline!
Neatline user/developer support and development is on hiatus while we seek a different institution to take over its future maintenance, development, and support.

We regret the difficulties this causes current users. Unfortunately, we do not have the resources to continue providing these public services at an acceptable level.

We are unable to provide user or developer support, and will not be able to make further changes or updates to the code or documentation.

## An introduction to Neatline
This guide is designed to be a comprehensive introduction to the Neatline project. We'll walk through the basic steps of [installing and configuring](installing-neatline.html) Neatline, [creating exhibits](exhibits-overview.html) and [records](records-overview.html), [importing](creating-records.html#bulk-importing-omeka-items) items from your [Omeka](http://omeka.org) collection, and [publishing](publishing-exhibits.html) your projects to the web.

Start with our [introduction](what-is-neatline.html), [browse](docs-TOC.html) the documentation, or search for specific topics.

## Help us improve this guide

As you read through the documentation, if you find anything that's unclear, incomplete, or incorrect be sure to file a support ticket on the project's [issue tracker](https://github.com/scholarslab/Neatline/issues) on GitHub, and we'll do our best to fix the problem!

## Community Documentation

The Neatline community has been creating documentation for their local users. If you know of Neatline community documentation, please [send us the link](mailto:scholarslab@virginia.edu), and we'll add it to the list.
