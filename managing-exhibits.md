- Click [**Public View**](#public-view) to open the public-facing version of the exhibit visible to anonymous users.
- Click [**Fullscreen View**](#fullscreen-view) to open the fullscreen public-facing view.

Once you've created one or more exhibits, the "Browse Exhibits" view makes it possible to find, filter, edit, and display them. There are a list of options available for managing individual exhibits:

## Exhibit Title

Click on the exhibit title to open up the editing environment for the exhibit, which makes it possible to edit exhibit styles and enabled plugins, and to create the collection of _records_ that constitutes the exhibit's content. For more information, see documentation on the [Neatline Editor](editor-overview.html) and [Records](records-overview.html).

## Public View

Click here to view the exhibit as it appears on the public-facing version of the website. This view displays your exhibit's [**Narrative**](creating-exhibits.html#narrative), if included in the **Exhibit Settings**. You can preview the public view of your Neatline exhibit even if your exhibit is not published. For more on publishing your Neatline exhibit, see [here](publishing-exhibits.html).

## Fullscreen View

Click here to view the public-facing fullscreen version of your exhibit. Unlike the **Public Vew**, the **Fullscreen View** does not include the aesthetics of your [Omeka Theme](https://omeka.org/classic/themes/), or your exhibit's [**Narrative**](creating-exhibits.html#narrative). 

## Exhibit Settings

Click here to re-display the form for the basic configuration settings that were defined when the exhibit was created (e.g.: **Title**, **URL Slug**, **Base Layers**). These values can be edited at any point after the exhibit has been created. For more on the **Exhibit Settings**, see [here](creating-exhibits.html#exhibit-settings).

## Import Items

Click here to open the form that makes it possible to populate the exhibit with content by bulk-importing Omeka items. For more information, see [**Importing Omeka Items**](importing-omeka-items.html).

## Duplicate

Click here to create a duplicate of the Neatline exhibit. A copy of the exhibit will be created, and can be found in the "Browse Exhibits" view. The title of the duplicate exhibit will default as the original exhibit's title, followed by "([your Omeka user name] copy)". You can change the exhibit title any time in [**Exhibit Settings**](creating-exhibits.html#exhibit-settings). 

Once created, the duplicate exhibit will exisit as a completely separate exhibit to the original. Any changes made to the original exhibit will not appear in the duplicate, or vice versa.

## Delete

Click here to permanently delete the exhibit. You'll get a pop-up message asking for confirmation. **Important**: When an exhibit is deleted, it is _completely_ removed from the database - along with all the records that belonged to it - and cannot be recovered.
