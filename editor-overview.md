# Neatline Editor: An Overview

## At a glance

- The Neatline editor is the interactive application that allows users to build the content of their Neatline exhibit.
- The [**Records**](#records) tab within the editor is where you create and search for Neatline records, the content of your exhibit.
- The [**Styles**](#styles) tab is where you can set an exhibit's default focus and zoom and use the Neatline stylesheet.
- The [**Plugins**](#plugins) tab allows you to access settings for the enabled Neatline widgets in the exhibit.

## Editor Overview

The Neatline editor is the interface where you build the content of your exhibit. Access the editing enviroment by clicking on the exhibit [title](managing-exhibits.html) in the "Browse Exhibits" view. The left panel within the editor includes tabs for **Records**, **Styles**, and **Plugins**. If there are no plugins (widgets) [enabled](creating-exhibits.html#widgets) for the exhibit, the **Plugins** tab will not be displayed.

On opening the exhibit editor, your selected [**Default Spatial Layer**](creating-exhibits.html#default-spatial-layer) will appear. For map layers, the default location is set at the coordinates 0° N, 0° E (to change your exhibit's default location, see [here](exhibit-styles-tab.html#default-map-focus).)

To view the [**Enabled Spatial Layers**](creating-exhibits.html#enabled-spatial-layers) in your exhibit, click on the layers icon on the right side of the page, and select a layer option to change the visible map base layer:

- [Default Map Focus and Zoom](exhibit-styles-tab.html#default-map-focus)
